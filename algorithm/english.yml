0. Just look at thing you want to realize
1. Duplicate "basic" folder into "experiments" (it is just a template for creation new things)
2. Go to the "index.html" file
  2.1 div with a "wrapper" class - it is an abstract element wich we can reuse for another things
    (for example:"button", "table", "grid", etc...). Rename the class as it should be
3. Go to the "style.css" file
  3.1 Use a class that was specified in 2.1
4 Describe it in such many attributes as you can (width, height, background-color, font, etc)
  4.1 Write your thing description in your own words if you do not know the attributes you want
  4.2 Google what you want in russian
  4.3 If you find the proper attribute name - go to the CSS/Reference and use it as it shown there
  4.* You can inspect element in Chrome to copy/paste some things (use it as rare as you can)

The html element ("wrapper" - it is just an abstract name):

<div class="wrapper">
  ...
  ...               <--- write some elements here (for example - text or another tags)
  ...
</div>

Can be accessed is css like so:

.wrapper {
  ...
  ...               <--- write some attributes here
  ...
}
